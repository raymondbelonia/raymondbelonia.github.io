# Rayray's Nicotine patch for a weird urge to create a blog at 1:29 in the morning.

Putting random text in here so that the index is not lonely while I am still making the site.

Hi and welcome to my blog.  I'm Raymond Anthony Belonia(Some of my friends call me Rayray, people I worked with call me Anthony) and I am an aspiring Ruby on Rails Developer.  I made this blog to actually practice some html and css skills that I haven't used much since school.  So far as you can see, it looks pretty basic.  In time I will make this a little bit prettier than it is now. :)
