# Hello World!

Putting random text in here so that the index is not lonely while I am still making the site.

As an excerpt from my long README file:

This self project is mainly for me to be able to create a blog of my own, familiarize myself with html, css, git commands, and the multiple things I can do with Twitter Bootstrap and Jekyll.  I have to admit that I am no web designer, so at least being good at using Twitter Bootstrap with basic to advance html and css skills should at least do the trick for a while.

This is a side project for me, as I am finishing the Ruby on Rails Tutorial Sample App, which is a twitter clone.  Basically I am almost finished with it, but at the moment I am sidetracked because of the blog thingy.  I aim to be a Ruby on Rails Developer, but with a very scarce knowledge about Web Development, I have to start at the bottom, and this is a cool and fun way for me to do it.  I write alot of things, not just coding, but really long essays, stuff I want think about and even short stories of my own.  Making a blog for it would be awesome.

So for now, this is my introduction. Thank you for reading and sorry for wasting 2 minutes of your time.
