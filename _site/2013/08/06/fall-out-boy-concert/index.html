		<h1>Fall Out Boy Concert</h1>
		<p class="muted">06 August 2013</p>

		<p>Non-technical stuff in this post.</p>

<p>As some people might know, me and my bestfriend Linette Debil will be going to the concert of the American Rock Band Fall Out Boy this coming August 8.  And as a big fan, this is huge, as this is their comeback tour so to speak(after the hiatus).  And I am really excited about this.</p>

<p>Fall Out Boy is a band that walked me through high school life.  It might not sound real but I HATED high school.  Only reason I went in there was due to friends, but then again that bit me in the ass at some point in the future.  During those hard times, weird as it is, FOB songs were ALWAYS in my playlists.  It was good thing too.  During those times, every FOB song I hear, I can relate to.  I can closely relate to "Sugar we're going down", even more to "Grand Theft Autumn" and "Nobody puts baby in the corner".  Their brand of music is one of links that connected me and Linette in the first place.</p>

<p>Linette is my bestfriend since high school.  We might not see each other as much as we used to, but we know we can never be apart.  We listen to the SAME THINGS, and that includes FOB.  I even have a HUGE debt to her, as I am broke at the moment, having to learn Ruby, Ruby on Rails and Behavioral Driven Development on my own, she has to pay for the tickets as I am really broke at the moment.  I will repay her 2 fold once I get an entry level Rails job at least.</p>

<p>This was supposed to be a blog post for the FOB concert, and it turns out to be a blogpost about me, Linette and the music we both love to listen to.  Oh well, I just really miss her.</p>

<p>So to turn this back into a FOB Concert post and still talk about my bestfriend whom I love very much, here is a part of a song that I wish they play at the concert.  Lini and I sang this together the last time we met and talked.</p>

<p>/I will sing to you everyday, if it would take away the pain.  Oh and I heard you got it(got it) so bad.  'cause I am the best you'll never have.../</p>
