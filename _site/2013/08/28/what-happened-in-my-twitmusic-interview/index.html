		<h1>What happened in my TwitMusic Interview?</h1>
		<p class="muted">28 August 2013</p>

		<p>Well, I finished the interview today.  In my view, it went well, although it could have been better.  First off, they are really nice people.  Chris was the one that interviewed and gave me stuff to do, and he was extremely nice.  Everyone in there was exceptionally nice.  I really like the work environment there, so as a first developer job, I would really love to be a part of their team.</p>

<p>So, Introduction.  Chris asked me to create a presentation about mysefl that should take 5 minutes.  It was fun to do, and it did help on controlling my nerves since I get to talk(A skill I got by working in the call center industry, wherein the more I talk, the more I get confident and do the job better).  Anyway, it's the normal stuff, so that part was just there for them to get to know me a little.  I put there the weird things I do, like collecting playing cards and Dragonball Action figures.  Those stuff, oh and the 2 TB worth of Anime that Ghie has, I mentioned that too.</p>

<p>Alright, on the Rails tests proper.  I knew I screwed up a little because of nerves since I knew almost every stuff in it.  First Chris asked me to talk about anything I knew on the list of technologies he provided.  I knew about 60% of them, the others were pretty much stuff that I think I cannot learn on my own, as I do not see any application of them on the small applications I do.  Then he made me create a rails app with three models, User,Article, Comment and other stuff.  I screwed up here on the part of the Article and Comment, I forgot to add the column user_id when I did the scaffold, so I had to add migrations.  That worked, however I was not able to create a form for it in the view due to lack of time.  Next, I was able to create an admin user using a rake task(although I do not know if that was the ideal way, but effective nonetheless).  Put small validations on the models, and associated them(has_many, belongs_to).  So I believe that part went well, considering I am really a newbie at Rails.</p>

<p>Then comes the Rails console test.  Here, I am pretty sure I screwed up bad.  The first question was to create a comment 10 times using one ruby line.  Now, I cannot remember how to do that.  I know how to do it using a do end block, but that isn't one line, so that is just what I did.  Next was to create 4 comments, 2 comments dated 10 days ago, 2 comments dated today.  i made the 2 comments dated today, however I cannot remember the syntax for 10 days ago until now.  I know it is along the lines of created_at: Date.10daysago(or something, I really cannot remember).  The last one was the to get all the comments user id and put them into an array.  Chris said after I wasn't able to do it that it has something to do with plot, but my Ruby knowledge ain't that good so I was hopeless there.  I was thinking that it has something to do with just the .to_a method but I was mistaken(or maybe there is a way to do it using the to_a method but time and nerves got me so I wasn't able to think straight).</p>

<p>I think it went well, they talked to me and told me they can offer me 15k for salary but I think that is not final.   I think that was nice actually, considering they will train me and this will seem like an internship type of a job at first if they hire me.  All in all, I do hope I get hired and start my Rails career with them.  This is an awesome opportunity and as I am in it to learn, I couldn't ask for more.  Here's to hoping I get hired! Cheers!</p>
