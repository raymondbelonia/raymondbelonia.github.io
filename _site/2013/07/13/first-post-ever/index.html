		<h1>First Post Ever</h1>
		<p class="muted">13 July 2013</p>

		<p>As the title say, this is my first blog post ever on this blog of mine.  While I am really doing this to actually setup the posts in the webpage, I still feel the need to at least write something relevant.  So here we go.  Random Rant #1 starts now.</p>

<p>I never liked the grade system of schools.  This might sound coming from someone who just don't want to study though but I really find it stupid.  The people who get high grades will always get praised for their hard work and some other crap, while the people who struggle below get pushed to the side.  I am not saying that the people who study hard shouldn't get praised, but they don't need the praises, they know they are good.  The people who need attention are the ones that have trouble to begin with.</p>

<p>There are several types of intelligence.  Some are good in academics, some are not.  It's just a matter of preference.  Others, like me, do not like to study stuff that I will not use ever.  Some glorify themselves by studying everything under the sun.  You just cannot put different kinds of people under the same system.</p>

<p>It's not always gloomy for people who failed though.  I myself failed subjects in college before.  It's not fun, it doesn't feel good and it takes time to pick yourself up after it, considering I have to live inside that rotten system.  But at least I know how to pick myself up after a failure and bounce back.  People who get high grades, dean listers and over-achievers never learns that in school, they learn it the hard way.  So that will be the biggest advantage of people who failed and bounced back.  We know how to handle failure, and in our society, that will save your ass.</p>
