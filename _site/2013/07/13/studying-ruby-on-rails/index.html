		<h1>Studying Ruby On Rails</h1>
		<p class="muted">13 July 2013</p>

		<p>Now, I think it is time to blog about Ruby On Rails.  Ruby On Rails is a web framework using the Ruby Programming Language.  I am not gonna go into history with this, but it is a really nice language and framework(Twitter is built using RoR).  This is coming from someone who hated studying Java(since I used C++/C# before) and also didn't like PHP.</p>

<p>Ruby is not that hard to learn, but like every programming language, you have to give it time to sink in.  Actually, you need more time to let it sink if you are the kind of person who gets comfortable coding in one language.  I myself found it weird at first, but I fell in love with it through time.  I am no expert in the Ruby language, as I honestly dived ahead to Ruby on Rails without learning everything in the Ruby language.  I just cannot see myself going through a 500-page book of pure Ruby without me making any web application, when that was my intention from the start.</p>

<p>Ruby on Rails.  I just cannot express how annoyed I am that I learned this technology a little late.  There are no words to describe how nice it is.  I am not saying it is the best web framework out there, but it's pretty close.</p>

<p>First things first, Rails is not Ruby(technically, it uses Ruby but you will get this when you try it).  Studying it seperately really depends on the person.  If you are the type of person that is organized and wanted to study everything first, go study Ruby first.  If you are like me, who study stuff when you need it, go ahead and study Rails, while studying small doses of Ruby along the way.  There are pretty nice tutorials and screencasts out there, namely railstutorial.org and Railscasts.</p>

<p>The Ruby Community is nice too, and here in the Philippines, the community is really great.  PHRUG(Philippine Ruby Users Group) is the best IT community I have known, and I met tons of great people in that community.  They are always willing to help new guys like me and point us to the right direction.</p>

<p>I am still a newbie on Rails, and as early as now, I know my aim is to be a web developer using Rails and I will stop at nothing to achieve it.  That's how much I loved Rails.</p>

<h3>Random Facts about me</h3>

<p>I collect playing cards, and of course I know a few card tricks to go with it.  I never go out without a music player.  I bring a headphone and an IEM wherever I go.  I don't like smartphones.</p>
