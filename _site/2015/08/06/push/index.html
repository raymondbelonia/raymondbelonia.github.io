		<h1>Push</h1>
		<p class="muted">06 August 2015</p>

		<p>I need a push.</p>

<p>I need a push in the right direction.  I can say that I indeed have been lazy.  You can tell, I said on my last post that I will code again and blog at least once a month.  But look at now, it is already August and the last code I have written was 2 months ago(nearly 3 months ago actually, this does not include the random stuff I code or refactor or fix which I still do at least 3x a week).  Am I really that lazy?  Do I lack determination?  I can say for certain that it isn't really the case.  Most of the basic knowledge I learned on my own coding in rails is still intact.  However, I think what I am lacking is that push.</p>

<p>I do not have any form of motivation to code since I am unemployed.  I like programming, I really do.  But I am lacking that push for me to keep on going at the moment.  I seriously believe I will end up doing it sooner or later, but I do wish it is soon.  Sounds really lazy, but I am that.  However, once I start doing something, I do it until I am satisfied with it.  Therefore, I know in myself that all I need is that push for me to start doing stuff.  I'm basically a car with a tank full of gas that is missing an ignition.  Once I find that key, I'll keep on going.</p>

<h3>Random Facts about me</h3>

<p>I collect playing cards, and of course I know a few card tricks to go with it.  I never go out without a music player.  I bring a headphone and an IEM wherever I go.  I don't like smartphones.</p>
