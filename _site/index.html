		<h1>Rayray's journey to randomness and weird urges to create a blog at 1:29 in the morning.</h1>

<p>Putting random text in here so that the index is not lonely while I am still making the site.</p>

<p>As an excerpt from my long README file:</p>

<p>This self project is mainly for me to be able to create a blog of my own, familiarize myself with html, css, git commands, and the multiple things I can do with Twitter Bootstrap and Jekyll.  I have to admit that I am no web designer, so at least being good at using Twitter Bootstrap with basic to advance html and css skills should at least do the trick for a while.</p>

<p>This is a side project for me, as I am finishing the Ruby on Rails Tutorial Sample App, which is a twitter clone.  Basically I am almost finished with it, but at the moment I am sidetracked because of the blog thingy.  I aim to be a Ruby on Rails Developer, but with a very scarce knowledge about Web Development, I have to start at the bottom, and this is a cool and fun way for me to do it.  I write alot of things, not just coding, but really long essays, stuff I want think about and even short stories of my own.  Making a blog for it would be awesome.</p>

<p>So for now, this is my introduction. Thank you for reading and sorry for wasting 2 minutes of your time.</p>

<p>Btw, to see my posts, click the name of the blog at the navigation bar.</p>

		<h3>About Me</h3>

<p>I'm Raymond Anthony Belonia.  I'm studying Ruby on Rails and Web Development in General.  I am still a newbie in all of this though.  This self project is one of my firsts that I can call my own.</p>

<p>Random facts about me:  I collect playing cards, and of course I know a few card tricks to go with it.  I never go out without a music player.  I bring a headphone and an IEM wherever I go.  I don't like smartphones.</p>
