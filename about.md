#About Me

I am an aspiring Web Developer, using Ruby on Rails.  I honestly am really new to web development, which is why I am trying to learn step by step.  If it comes to background, I cannot boast much.  Before jumping and learning Ruby and Ruby on Rails, the best language I can use was C++ and a little of Java.  For some reason, Java never agreed with me, and I didn't agree with it as well.  No matter how hard I tried, I just never liked Java, which astounded tons of my friends in the field.  

I used to be a not-so-good programmer.  The reason probably is because I didn't like the stuff they tried to teach at school.  I am now learning Ruby and Ruby on Rails on my own, with a help from a few of my friends that are using it.  So far, they have taught me more than school ever taught me.  Turns out, I just have to like what I am doing, and I love Ruby on Rails.

Moving on from my technical background, I'll be telling something personal.  I am a fan of the Harry Potter series and it helped me go through childhood with not much damage morally.  I also am a fan of magic, and I do collect playing cards and do some card tricks, but not too much.  I love watching Anime, good thing my girlfriend is an otaku and she keeps me updated.  My favorite movie is still The Crow.  My type of music usually revolves on me relating to the lyrics.  With that said, my favorite bands include The Beatles, The Smiths, Led Zeppelin, AC/DC and Queen from the past.  The modern ones that I mostly listen to are Fall Out Boy, Panic! at the Disco, The Cab, Paramore, The Script, Fun. and The Calling.  For my favorite artists, I listen to mostly songwriters like Ed Sheeran and Taylor Swift.
