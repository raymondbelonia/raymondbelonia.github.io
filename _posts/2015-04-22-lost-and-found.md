So, I come back after almost a year of not touching this blog.

As the title says, I was lost and then found.

Not in the sense that I really got lost literally.  I was lost on what to do in life.  I was thinking that coding was not for me, and I might not really make it (talk about confidence issues).  But I also found out that I do not really want to do anything else that is not related to technology.  And I do love web development, even if I am a newbie at it.

So here I am, back at blogging and maintaining this github page.  I will try to consistently talk about anything here, while also looking for an entry-level Rails job.  I don't even mind if it is an internship, as long as I learn something that the tutorials cannot.  As Terence said before, I basically am already level 20 and I am still trying to level up with level 1 content.  So yeah, I need a challenge to spark that interest again, and the only way to find it is to find a job.  

Wish me luck, and see you in May.
