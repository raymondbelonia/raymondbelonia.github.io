I'm scared in all honesty.  I been a bum for like a year now, and while I do have a grasp on what Ruby on Rails is(in a beginner stand point), I still have that fear of not getting the job.  Well, I am not doing anything to try and get a job so I guess I cannot talk much.  Terence always said that I can do it, but I probably should stop doubting myself before I try, or else I will probably screw things up more.  

I do think I should get an entry level job by this year.  Doesn't matter how much it pays atm, all I want is to learn more about Rails, and I do believe that I cannot do it on my own anymore.  I already am through 2 books, and I do get the basics and stuff but if I wanna dive in more, I would need mentors as I am not good enough.  

I have one last book to try and finish, I treat it as a review as this book is pretty much basic, then I will have to read the part 3 of the Agile Web Development in Rails 4 where more info about Rails is put in.  Should take me less than a month to be prepared for my next interview I guess.

I would have to say, while I didn't expect to be called by TwitMusic, them not reply a year ago made my confidence drop rock bottom.  Not blaming them, rather blame myself for not knowing more and expecting more.  Oh well.
