title: Working Again Anxiety
layout: posts

Ever since I finished learning the basic foundations needed for Ruby on Rails, I had this type of anxiety.  I worked before as a Tech Support Agent Level 2 so I am no newbie in working for a pay.  However, if I do try to find a job, this will be the first time that I will try to look for a job in the field of Web Development.  My anxiety starts when I realize that I do not really have a good credential.  

I never worked in Web Development.  I am new to it, I got no credentials but my school record(which we have to admit, not so good), and the self projects I made during my time of learning Ruby on Rails(The twitter clone application, which I already finished the core, but I am adding some features, and of course this blog that got really basic design from bootstrap).  

Although my friend who worked in the industry already told me that I have the skills to land an entry level position, I still think otherwise.  What if I don't get hired?  What if all the months that I studied and never worked didn't pay off?  I can't face my girlfriend, who stuck by me being a bum for the past months, if that happens.  I know I am thinking way ahead here, but you can't really blame me.  It's not that I am new to failure, I know how to handle it.  The problem is at this point, failure really isn't much of an option.

I plan on looking for an entry level Rails job starting September.  The reason why I will start then is because I want one more month to actually put extensions to the twitter clone AND learn more about Rspec, Cucumber and testing stuff.  If I am able to do that within a month or so, learning on the job shouldn't be much of a problem since I know writing good tests makes me code better.

I probably choke on this anxieties if I don't fight it.  That's kinda the reason I put it in the blog in the first place.  So to anyone reading this: HELP
