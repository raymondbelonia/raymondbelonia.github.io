Alright, tomorrow I will be having my first job interview in the field that I like, which is web development.  Now I don't know how it will turn out, or if my skills were enough to land me the job, but I am hopeful that they are.  Anyway, I am up for an interview at TwitMusic.  I will do my best to get me this job since it really sounds to be the job for me.  I mean, web development centered around music? What more can I want right?

I think I will just have to wing it.  If I get hired, awesome.  If not, that just means I have to learn a lot more.  I am not thinking that I will not get it, but I have to think of that possibility.  That way it wouldn't be as disappointing as it should be.  But of course, I am still on the mentaility that I will indeed get the job, as it is an entry-level Rails job.  As said in the previous post back in august 4, I still have working again anxiety, so tomorrow is the day that I will put the stuff I learned in the past months to the test.  Goodluck to me, I guess.
